## Description

In 2011 a [backdoor was added to the VSFTPd source code](https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2011/07/alert-vsftpd-download-backdoored.html?source=post_page---------------------------). Since then, it's become a well know CTF challenge to exploit. While the exploit is trivial to pull off manually with `nc` or `telnet`, I wanted to write a script to do it. This script will not rely on having `sh` or `bash` on the target listening on 6200.

I'll also include a copy of the vulnerable source tarball for reference. This is for educational purposes only.
